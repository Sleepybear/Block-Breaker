The sound files I am using in my final package are paid assets, and as such I cannot freely share them. 

Currently there are 4 Sound events:

1. Ball hits Paddle/Player
2. Ball hits Wall
3. Ball hits Block
4. Block is Destroyed

You can use the same sound asset for multiple events, you just need to link the asset to the prefabs (Ball and Block) in the Unity editor. 

Please feel free to contact me with questions.
