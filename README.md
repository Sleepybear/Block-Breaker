Block Breaker Clone (Working title)
======

Created this Block Breaker clone while taking the [GameDev.tv](http://www.gamedev.tv) Unity 2D Course. 
Current plans for expanding:
+ Power-Up from broken blocks
  + Sticky Ball
  + Multi Ball
  + Speed Changes
  + Laser Weapon
  + Paddle Width
+ Debuffs
  + Decrease Paddle Width
  + Increase Block Stifness
  + Change Physics?
+ Possible GFX Updates
+ More Levels!
  + Procedurally generated?
+ High Score System

## Please Note:
Due to the Audio FX I used being paid assets, I am not storing them on public github. I have put a placeholder in the [Assets/Sounds/] Folder.  
Once you import your Audio Assets, you will want to link them in Unity Editor to the Ball Prefab and the Block prefab for the sounds you want to use.
